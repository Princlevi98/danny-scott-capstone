Lessons Learned & Next Steps -

I was happy that i was able to implement some skills i have learned over the 3 months by using some state/effect and params as well as some new things i have learned outside of class such as the slideshow. i struggled with some of the endpoints and getting data from the backend which was a short fall.

Next Steps -

i would like to go back and attempt fix my endpoints to gain the neccesary data from the back end to render on the front end so the users can interact with it.
